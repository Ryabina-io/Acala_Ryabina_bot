There are two main functions: to alert about events that take place with accounts and to collect statistic about network status. However the variety of possible single notifications and combinations of notifications is huge, that makes this bot very useful and powerful tool.

Bot can be used in two ways:

* as a **personal** informational bot, sending alerts in a private chat;

* as informational bot for **Telegram groups** showing statistic of network and current prices of currencies(ACA, DOT, LDOT, RenBTC, XBTC and others).

## **Personal informational bot.**

You can find it here: [https://t.me/Acala_Ryabina_bot](https://t.me/Acala_Ryabina_bot)
All notifications are divided into 6 groups:

* **Accounts alerts** is a block of notifications about Transfers and Ren Mint/Burn.

* **CDP Loans**üí∞**‚Äî **all alerts about loans, Collateralized Debt Positions(CDP)

    You can find here one of the most useful alerts - "***liquidate CDP warning***", that means that tracked CDP is dangerously close to liquidation (115% of liquidation price) and, perhaps, need some actions to be done.

* **Liquidation Auction** ‚Äî about auction bids and auctions.

* **Honzon Parameters**. Honzon ‚Äî The Stablecoin Protocol. No address required.

* **Dex ‚Äî Swap, Deposit and Earn**. All events related to swap, Deposit & Earn, add/withdraw liquidity.

* üî•**Advanced**üî• collected all the events and extrinsics of all the modules. It‚Äôs a big list.

### **Advanced mode.**

If pre-configured notifications are not enough, please choose Advanced mode. Please be noted that you should understand what [Substrate](https://www.substrate.io/) is to get maximum value from this mode.

You can also visit [https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala/wiki](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala/wiki) for more information.

All [Events](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/events) and [Extrinsics](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/learn-substrate/extrinsics) are collected here. In short, Extrinsics ‚Äî are methods that either users or smart contracts call in the network, Events ‚Äî are the events that these methods trigger.

Also they are grouped into modules.

Next step is to set up Filters. Please be noted that correct use of Filters is very important stage and helps you to avoid unnecessary information.

*For example: in case Filter Target is not selected for Event Transfer bot will send information about ALL transfers in the network.
